# DeepNeuralNetwork

DNN_Classifier contains a Python class that implements a Fully Connected - Neural Network by using Tensorflow. It is compatible with Scikit Learn's **RandomizedSearchCV** class in order to perform hyperparameters tuning. 

It is possible to build and fit a model with the desired numbers of layers and neurons per layer. L1, L2 and drop-out regularization techniques can be enables, as well as early stopping and gradient clipping.
